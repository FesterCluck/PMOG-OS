  id: "9"
  long_description: Shoats are free to roam PMOG as they will, associating with Order and Chaos both. Shoats may recline on the green swaths of PMOG space, under the glittering moon, thinking only of the joy of undiscovered portals - never fearing retribution or the unordering of their precious tag stacks. No, those thoughts are reserved for the dark moments of each day, when the Other rises in force against you and you must sacrifice your sweet pink flesh to the fires of battle. O! sweet Shoat, it is the best of times and the worst of times.
