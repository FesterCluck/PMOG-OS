== Engine Yard Cluster Setup ==

New Env:
  slice 13 on node 0 with 5120MB, 4 VCPU
  slice 14 on node 1 with 5120MB, 4 VCPU
  slice 15 on node 2 with 5120MB, 4 VCPU
  slice 25 on node 1 with 1280MB, 1 VCPU (utility)

New IRC Env:
  slice 26 on node 2 with 1280MB, 1 VCPU (ircserver)

Database master:
  e0: mysql50-1-master (mysql-master) [] [0 (possible) web apps]
    slice 0 on node 0 with 4096MB, 2 VCPUs

Database replica:
  e1: mysql50-1-replica (mysql-replica) [] [0 (possible) web apps]
    slice 1 on node 1 with 4096MB, 2 VCPUs

Database staging and metrics:
  e3: mysql50-staging-1 (mysql-replica) [] [0 (possible) web apps]
    slice 3 on node 2 with 4096MB, 2 VCPUs
  Note that the gamelayers_db user on here has read only access to all databases, except pmog_staging.
  Note that pmog_production is a replicated copy of the PMOG database.
  Note also that pmog_jira is a replicated copy of the Jira database.

We'll increase the mongrel count by up to 4x and also increase the memcached size by 3x or more.

== Staging ==
  Our staging server, dev.pmog.com, runs from our Staging slice (gl00-s00024)
  - not much else happens on here

== Utility ==
  Our utility slice, gl00-s00025, shares /data with the production slice
  Deploying to production will therefore update the code on utility

== Backups ==
  We backup the database, image assets and codebase daily
  - they run from our Utility slice (gl00-s00025)
  - via a cronjob that calls script/backup which in turn calls rake pmog:backup_to_s3
  - recent backups are stored locally for a short period
  - all backups are stored in Amazon S3

== Background Jobs ==
  Background jobs are long running processes that would otherwise tie up the production database, like badges and stats.
    - Job run on our Utility slice (gl00-s00025)
    - Jobs are submitted to BJ via a cron job
    - Jobs run with a RAILS_ENV of cron, which mimics production.

== Jira ==
  Runs on our Utility slice (gl00-s00025)
  - accessible via hospital.pmog.com:8080
  - the data lives in a pmog_jira database on staging (gl00-s00003)
  - the Jira app lives in /home/gamelayers/marc/jira

== IRC ==
  Players can chat on our own irc server at irc.pmog.com
  - uses UnrealIRCD and Anope Services
  - runs on our IRC slice (gl00-s00026)
  - can be started by running start_irc.sh (see doc/start_irc.txt)

== SSH ==
  See doc/ssh_config.txt for the ssh details for each slice/server.
