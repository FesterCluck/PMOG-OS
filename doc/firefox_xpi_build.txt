Now we have a Firefox extension anyone can download.  The GUID is pmog@gamelayers.com.  Here's the .xpi:

http://pmog.com/firefox/pmog.xpi

There's a longer help page for semi-guided install as well:

= Posting Patches =

To push an upgrade to our users, we need to:

0. in /trunk/public/firefox move pmog.xpi to be pmog-version.xpi for archiving
1. edit /trunk/config/xpi.yml with the new version number
2. from /trunk run rake pmog:xpi:hud
3. from /trunk run rake pmog:xpi:stage
4. edit /trunk/app/views/about/versions.html.erb to reflect the update
5. cap production deploy
6. post xpi to addons.mozilla
7. write about something new and wonderful that we released on news.pmog.com

PLEASE NOTE:

There exists a second update.rdf, at /trunk/public/update.rdf.  This file is in stasis for PMOG players of mid-2007, still using pmog@bud.com.  The moment we want to activate these players, we can increment that <em:version> with new URLs and they will receive a notice.

So:

/trunk/public/update.rdf - testers with pmog@bud.com
/trunk/public/firefox/update.rdf - testers with pmog@gamelayers.com

edit /trunk/public/firefox/update.rdf to incrementally share improvements with our current testers!

Cheers - justin@bud.com
