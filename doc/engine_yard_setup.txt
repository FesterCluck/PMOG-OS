=Documenting the setup process for any new EY slice=

  Gems:
    Required:
      ruby-openid
      memcache-client
      dike (for memory profiling)
      ruby-debug
      image_science
    Optional (frozen into lib already)
      rspec
      tzinfo
      rails_analyzer_tools

    A full list, EY style:
      <gem name="dike" />
      <gem name="gruff" />
      <gem name="memcache-client" />
      <gem name="production_log_analyzer" />

      <gem name="ruby-openid" />
      <gem name="ruby-yadis" />
      <gem name="tzinfo" />
      <gem name="uuidtools" />

  RubyGems:
    Run 'sudo gem install eyrubygems --source http://gems.engineyard.com'  locally

  Site admins:
    rake pmog:grant_site_admin RAILS_ENV=production

  Folders:
    Create a backups folder in /home/pmog for cron-enabled backups.
    Create an image_assets folder in public/system for shared images between deployments.
    Create a data folder in public/shared for shared benchmarking results.

  Rspec (Deleted rspec as it was a pain to setup):
    Run 'script/generate rspec' to update spec/spec_helper.rb
    
  Nginx config:
    add rdf as text/xml to the mime.types file for nginx
  
=Deploy=

  The deploy script symlinks a few files from /data/pmog/shared/config/ for things like memcached.yml
  and database.yml.
  
  For memcached, note that the memcached.yml on staging points to ey01-s00093:11211 and on production
  it points to ey01-s00094:11211. Locally, memcached.yml from subversion points to localhost.

=Memcached=

  Production setup, as created by Engine Yard:
  
    defaults:
      ttl: 1800
      readonly: false
      urlencode: false
      c_threshold: 10000
      compression: true
      debug: false
      namespace: app
      sessions: false
      session_servers: false
      fragments: false
      memory: 64 
      servers: ey01-s00094:11211
      benchmarking: true
      raise_errors: true
      fast_hash: false
      fastest_hash: false

    production:
      memory: 64 
      benchmarking: false
      servers:
        - ey01-s00094:11211

=IPs, PHPMyAdmin, Cap tasks, etc=

  Production:
    65.74.151.41
    65.74.139.2:8094

  Staging:
    65.74.151.40
    65.74.139.2:8093

  PHPMyAdmin:
    https://myadmin.utility.ey01.engineyard.com
    mysql50-2

  Cap:
    cap staging deploy
    cap staging deploy:migration

    cap production deploy
    cap production deploy:migration

  Crontab:
    Each new slice must have the scripts from crontab_staging or crontab_production setup like this:
  
      /data/pmog/shared/scripts/whatever.sh

=Memcached=

  It's on all EY slices, however there's a new gem we can use. Installed like this:
    emerge -g libmemcached; gem install memcached --no-rdoc --no-ri

=Munin & Monit=

  Munin had to be installed and run by hand, but Monit seems to be installed by default.
  Monit only offers the web admin age locally though, via `lynx localhost:9111`
  
=Nginx=

  /etc/nginx/servers/pmog.conf
  # this allows people to use images and css in their maintenance.html file
  if ($request_filename ~* \.(css|jpg|gif|png)$) {
    break;
  }

  # this rewrites all the requests to the maintenance.html
  # page if it exists in the doc root. This is for capistrano's
  # disable web task
  if (-f $document_root/system/maintenance.html) {
    rewrite  ^(.*)$  /system/maintenance.html last;
    break;
  }

  location /track/ {
    root /data/pmog/current/public;
    return 404;
    break;
  }

  location / {

    location ~ ^/system/data(.*)/ {
      auth_basic "Restricted Area";
      auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/sites/pmog/users;
    }  

    <snip>
  }
  
  Also add .xpi to the mime types files
