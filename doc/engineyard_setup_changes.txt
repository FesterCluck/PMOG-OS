= Steps we've taken with Engine Yard =

  - Bought second slice
  - Used memcahed
  - Increased to 1Gb memory on each slice
  - Moved badges to dev server
  - Moved backups to dump to /data
  - Added nice to crontabs
  
  * add to this as required
  
  - Disabled ruby-debug in codebase (can cause leaks)
  - Switched from RMagick to Image Science
  - Removed fair proxy balancer from all slices, as it can overload nginx when traffic is high
  - Worked with atmos to sync slices and bring a third one online (SXSW 2008)
  - Moved to new database slice as we were swamping the existing one.
  
  - Moved to a V10 cluster - 20th April 2008
  - 3GB RAM on database slices
  - MySQL innodb buffer increased from 512MB to 2048MB
