= Using wget to browse pmog.com as a logged in user =

Grab auth_token from your Firerfox session (Preferences, Privacy, Show cookies).

Copy and paste that into cookies.txt.

Then use wget to browse the site as a logged in user:

wget -S --load-cookies cookies.txt http://pmog.com/users/suttree

Or, to deploy a lightpost from the command line (note that we pass auth_token as a parameter, rather than a cookie, as this is how the extension does it):

wget -S --post-data 'auth_token=7142fb4724e676333579696d9d5154908dbf8d14' http://pmog.com/locations/4699bd20-97a4-11dc-9432-00163e4ab66d/lightposts.js

Measure the size of the page using wget:
  wget -p --convert-links http://0.0.0.0:3000/users/suttree

And kinda of the same thing using curl:
  curl -w '\nDownload size:\t%{size_download} bytes\n' -o /dev/null -s http://0.0.0.0:3000/users/suttree
