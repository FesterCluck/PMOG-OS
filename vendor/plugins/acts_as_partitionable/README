ActsAsPartitionable
===================

Partitioning the daily_domains table by month and year.

This plugin *does not work*, it is a work in progress as I attempt to extract the plugin out of the codebase once it is working reliably.


Example
=======

Add this line to any model you want partitioned

acts_as_partitionable :prefix => 'daily_domains'
