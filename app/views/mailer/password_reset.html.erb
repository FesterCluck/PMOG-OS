Hello <%= @login -%> -

Someone, hopefully you, has attempted to reset your password for The Nethernet.

First, please make sure you are not logged into the website when you try to log into the toolbar.

Secondly, please make sure you have the latest version of our game available here: http://thenethernet.com/xpi/pmog.xpi

Third, please try the following credentials, being sure to use your username and not your e-mail address:

Your username is: <%= @login -%>

Our computer has generated this password for you: <%= @password -%>

Visit <%= url_for :controller => "session", :action => :new, :only_path => false, :escape => false %> to login.  After you login using your password, you can change it to something more memorable.

If you have any questions or issues, please write to support@gamelayers.com!

Thank you for your patience,

-The Nethernet Team
