		  You have successfully laid a mine!  You can
      explode your own mines, by the way, if you
      reload a page with one of your mines on it
      (like you just did).<br /><br />

      Weâ€™ll heal you up this time.  Now, you can
      lay a mine on any site on the Internet, and
      hopefully catch another player in your
      playful trap!<br /><br />
