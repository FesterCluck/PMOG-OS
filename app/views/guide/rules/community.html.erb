<li>You will follow the direction of any Trustee pertaining to the enforcement of this policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a player elects to violate the the aforementioned The Nethernet Community Standards and Expectations, any/all of the following actions may be taken, depending on severity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any/all offending tags, avatars, posts, messages, missions, comment, and/or tools (including the messages within tools), etc., may be permanently deleted.</li>

<li>The player may receive a written warning, a suspension from the game, or their account permanently removed.</li>

<li>The player may forfeit any/all unearned tools, badges, and/or datapoints gained knowingly or unknowingly from active or passive exploitation of a bug, error, and/or unintentional change.</li>

<li>The player may lose the ability to access certain functions of the game such as, but not limited to: tagging, PMail, the forums or commenting.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you feel another player has violated the terms of this policy against you personally or in general, please send an e-mail to abuse at thenethernet dot com detailing the situation.</p>
