<h1>Stewards</h1>
<h5>Watchers and helpers</h5>
<br/>

<p>Stewards are PMOG players who help moderate our forums and other user-generated content. They are selected by GameLayers, Inc. and evaluated on a person-to-person basis.</p>

<p>Stewards are players who volunteer their time, patience and sanity to assist new players getting acquainted with PMOG, and also help to ensure the <a href="/about/community">Community Standards and Expectations</a> are being upheld. They are entrusted with some abilities above and beyond the normal PMOG citizen, including the ability to close threads, or remove inappropriate comments from missions.</p>

<p>For example, if a Steward comes across an especially helpful post in the forum, they can pin it. Conversely, if they come across an especially unhelpful, hate-filled post in the forum, they can lock it until a Trustee can further address the issue.</p>

<p>Stewards are not admins, and should not be viewed as such. Complaints, general help requests, feedback for the developers, reports of abuse, and so forth should still be directed to the normal <a href="/about/contact">avenues of communication</a>. Instead, Stewards should be seen as community representatives who have demonstrated a knowledge, dedication and willingness to further better our community.</p>

<p>You will be able to identify someone as a Steward by the designation that will appear on their profile or beneath their name on messages they post in the forums.</p>
